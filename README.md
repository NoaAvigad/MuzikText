### Read & Respond To Texts From Your Headphones

Using the open source Apache Cordova plugin, you can now "read" and respond to SMS from your headphones.

###### Current Features:
- Use of your contacts to notify you who sent you the text ("Message from Noa")
- Use of hotkey to listen to the most recent text
- Ability to enter pre-configured responses into the app on your phone (unlimited # of responses)
- Ability to swipe through potential responses on headphones
- Sending current response out to most recent text.

###### Future Features:
- Switching between Music + Text mode
- Hotkey to hear the current time
- Speech-to-Text to allow dictating text response
- Queueing up messages so you can respond to more than just the most recent message
- Scrolling through contacts so you can initiate a conversation rather than just responding to one
